## Installation

### Package Control

The easiest way to install using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/).

1. Open `Command Palette` using menu item `Tools â†’ Command Palette...`

2. Choose `Package Control: Install Package`

3. Find `Grunt` and hit `Enter`

### Manually

If you prefer a manual approach, follow the steps below.

1. Goto into Sublime Text Packages directory, which you can find
   using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`

2. Clone this repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sptndc/sublime-grunt.git Grunt
    ```

3. Enjoy!

## Usage

Open the Command Palette:

* macOS: <kbd>cmd+shift+P</kbd>
* Linux/Windows: <kbd>ctrl+shift+P</kbd>

Now choose the "Grunt" command.

The plugin expects to find a Gruntfile (`Gruntfile.js` or
`Gruntfile.coffee`) in an open folder. It displays a sorted list of
available Grunt tasks out of this Grunt file. If it finds more than
one Gruntfile, it first provides a list for selection.

As of version 0.2, there is also a command to kill running tasks, for
example `watch` tasks.

## Settings

The file `Grunt.sublime-settings` is used for configuration.

You may override your `PATH` environment variable as follows:

```
{
    "exec_args": {
        "path": "node_modules/.bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin"
    }
}
```

If your GruntFile is not in the base path of the project, then you
can add the path(s) to check as follows:

```
{
    "gruntfile_paths": [
        "/path",
        "/another/path",
        "/one/final/path"
    ]
}
```

Alternatively, this could be set per-project in your .sublime-project
settings object.
